A simple linked list implementation in Java.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Blackscs/dataStructure.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory `dataStructure`:
   ```
    cd dataStructure
   ```

3. Compile the source code:
   ```
    javac LinkedList.java
   ```

4. Run the test program:
   ```
    java LinkedList
   ```

## Use

You can use this linked list to store and manipulate a sequence of strings.

Code example:

```java
LinkedList list = new LinkedList("value1");
list.append("value2");
list.append("value3");
list.append("value4");
list.remove(0);
list.getStatusList();
```

This will print the status of the list after adding some values and removing the first item.
